## INTRODUCTION :

Hello my name is Kulendu Kashyap Chakraborty, currently a 1st year CSE undergrad student at GIMT, Guwahati. I'm a summer intern at Cosmic Skills taking the Machine Learning course. This is an awesome course, so after completion of the project now its time for the Projects submission. For the projects I'm facing problems in converting the code files into .rar format, so I decided to make this repository and share the links of the consecutive projects in the mail.


## LIST OF THE PROJECTS :

1. [Character Recognition Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/character_recog)
2. [Face Recognition Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/face_recog)
3. [Recommendation System Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/recommendation_system)
4. [Species Recognition Project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DlGY3vo5v7TOlJGzCaAzSi_rt20IV-YN?usp=sharing)


## CONTENTS & DETAILS OF THE PROJECT :

### 1. [Character Recognition Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/character_recog) -

* PROJECT CONTENT DETAILS -

1. **Project Name :** Character Recognition Project
2. **Aim of the Project :**  The aim of this project is to develop such a tool which takes an Image as input and extract characters (alphabets, digits, symbols) from it. The Image can be of handwritten document or Printed document. It can be used as a form of data entry from printed records.
3. **Tools required for the development of the Project :** This project is based on Machine learning, We can provide a lot of data set as an Input to the software tool which will be recognized by the machine and similar pattern will be taken out from them. We can use Matlab or Octave as a building tool for this product but Octave is recommended in initial state as its free and easy to use.
4. **Project Output Images :** ![](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/blob/master/images/Python2.jpg)
5. **Conclusion :** Classification of characters and learning of image processing techniques is done in  this  project. The result which was got was correct up to more than 90% of the cases, but it would be improved at the end. This work was basically focused on envisaging  methods that can efficiently extract feature  vectors  from each individual character. The method I came up with gave efficient and effective result both forfeature extraction as well as recognition.There are also different methods through which ‘handwritten character recognition’ is achieved.

### 2. [Face Recognition Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/face_recog) -
1. **Project Name :** Face Recognition Project
2. **Aim of the Project :** A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database. It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person by analyzing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape.
3. **Tools required for the development of the Project :** With machine learning you must characterize the problem in a way that makes it susceptible to machine learning, and then you must understand if you have the data that can help solve that problem. Next, you define a model, train the model with training data and test the model, hoping that your training resulted in a high probability of success. If it didn’t, you tweak your model and retrain.
4. **Project Output images :** 
5. **Conclusion :** The  computational  models,  which  were  implemented  in  this  project,  were  chosen  after extensive  research,  and  the  successful  testing  results  confirm  that  the  choices  made  by  the researcher were reliable.The system with manual face detection and automatic face recognition did not have a recognition accuracy over 90%, due to the limited number of eigenfaces that were used for the PCA transform.  This system  was tested  under very  robust conditions in this experimental study  and  it  is  envisaged  that  real-world  performance  will  be  far  more  accurate.The  fully automated  frontal  view  face  detection  system  displayed  virtually  perfect  accuracy  and  in  the researcher's opinion further work need not be conducted in this area.

### 3. [Recommendation System Project](https://github.com/kulendu/ML_internship_projects/tree/master/recommendation_system) -
1. **Project Name :** Recommendation System Project
2. **Aim of the Project :** The aim of a recommender system is to estimate the utility of a set of objects belonging to a given domain, starting from the information available about users and objects. Adaptive e-learning systems are able to automatically generate personalized learning experiences starting from a learner profile and a set of target learning goals. Starting form research results of these fields we defined a methodology to recommend learning goals and to generate learning experiences for learners of an adaptive e-learning system.
3. **Tools required for the development of the project :** For this project development we does not require much tools, just we need to install a python package 'mlxtend' that takes care of the preprocessig and other stuffs. Just have to make a strong build on the algorithm. Here we have used a datasets containing all the items to be brought from the market.

5. **Conclusion :** Thus building this project can help people in making the next things easy, by keeping a track on their previous history. This is mostly used in social apps, ecommerce sites etc.

### 4. [Species Recognition Project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DlGY3vo5v7TOlJGzCaAzSi_rt20IV-YN?usp=sharing) -
1. **Project Name :** Species Recognition Project.
2. **Aim of the Project :** Object detection is one of the classical problems in computer vision where you work to recognize what and where — specifically what objects are inside a given image and also where they are in the image. The problem of object detection is more complex than classification, which also can recognize objects but doesn’t indicate where the object is located in the image. In addition, classification doesn’t work on images containing more than one object.
3. **Tools required for the Project Development :** Here we have used the YOLO(You Only Look Once). YOLO uses a totally different approach. YOLO is a clever convolutional neural network (CNN) for doing object detection in real-time. The algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image, and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.YOLO is popular because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. The algorithm “only looks once” at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the neural network to make predictions. After non-max suppression (which makes sure the object detection algorithm only detects each object once), it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.With YOLO, a single CNN simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. YOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detection performance.

5. **Conclusion :** An accurate and efficient object detection system has been developed which achieves compa-rable metrics with the existing state-of-the-art system.  This project uses recent techniques inthe field of computer vision and deep learning.  Custom dataset was created using labelImgand the evaluation was consistent.  This can be used in real-time applications which requireobject detection for pre-processing in their pipeline.An important scope would be to train the system on a video sequence for usage in trackingapplications.  Addition of a temporally consistent network would enable smooth detectionand more optimal than per-frame detection.
